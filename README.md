# Dice Rolling Simulator

## Overview

This Python script implements a simple dice rolling simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The application allows users to roll a virtual six-sided die by clicking a button, with the corresponding dice face displayed as an image.

## Code Structure

- `script_name.py`: The main Python script for the dice rolling simulator.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the script.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `tkinter`: GUI library included in standard Python installations.
- `PIL`: Python Imaging Library for working with images.

Install PIL using:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Running the Simulator
python script_name.py

1. The GUI window will appear with a greeting label, an initial dice image, and a "Roll the Dice" button.
2. Click the "Roll the Dice" button to simulate rolling the die, and the displayed image will change accordingly.

## Customization
You can add or modify dice images by updating the dice list with filenames.
